<ul>
  <li>Utilized a neural network to build a recommender system for movies.</li>
  <li>Derived a movie ratings dataset from the MovieLens (ml-latest-small) dataset.</li>
  <li>Prepared the training data by scaling and splitting it into training and test sets.</li>
  <li>Computed the dot product between user and movie vectors to make predictions.</li>
  <li>Provided functionality for making predictions for new users and finding similar items.</li>
</ul>


### steps followed by code:
<ul>
  <li>1- Movie ratings dataset</li>
  <li>2- Content-based filtering with a neural network</li>
  <li>Third item

  <li>3- Neural Network for content-based filtering</li>
  <li>4- Predictions</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Predictions for a new user</li>
      <li>Predictions for an existing user</li>
      <li>Finding Similar Items</li>
